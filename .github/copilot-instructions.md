# Laravel Boost PhpStorm with GitHub Copilot Plugin - Project Guidelines

## Project Overview

This is a Laravel package that provides custom CodeEnvironment integration for PhpStorm with GitHub Copilot plugin with Laravel Boost. It enables Laravel projects to use GitHub Copilot plugin in PhpStorm with Laravel Boost's MCP (Model Context Protocol) server functionality.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: PHP 8.3+
- **Framework**: Laravel 12.x+
- **Dependencies**: Laravel Boost 1.7+
- **Target Platforms**: macOS, Linux, Windows (Native Windows supported)
- **Testing**: Pest PHP 4.x
- **Code Quality**: Laravel Pint (PSR-12)

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **PhpStormCopilot.php**: Main CodeEnvironment implementation
   - Implements `McpClient` interfaces
   - Handles detection, configuration, and MCP installation
   - Generates system-wide MCP config file
   - `src/Concerns/WithWSL.php` trait is just for code splitting purposes

2. **PhpStormCopilotServiceProvider.php**: Laravel service provider
   - Registers the PhpStormCopilot CodeEnvironment with Laravel Boost
   - Auto-discovered via Laravel's package discovery

### Key Features

- System-wide PhpStorm and GitHub Copilot plugin detection
- MCP server configuration for PhpStorm's GitHub Copilot plugin
- System-wide MCP installation strategy (not project-local)
- Integration with `php artisan boost:install` and `boost:update` commands
- Multi-project support with per-project configuration updates

## Code Style Guidelines

### PHP Standards
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards (enforced by Laravel Pint)
- Use strict types declaration (`declare(strict_types=1);`)
- Use return type declarations for all methods
- Follow Laravel conventions and best practices
- Run `composer lint` before committing
- Verify formatting with `composer test:lint`

### Namespace Convention
- Root namespace: `Revolution\Laravel\Boost`
- Follow PSR-4 autoloading standards
- Test namespace: `Tests\`

## Development Guidelines

### When Making Changes

1. **Service Provider**: Only modify for registration logic
2. **PhpStormCopilot Class**: 
   - Keep detection configs simple and reliable
   - Maintain compatibility with Laravel Boost interfaces
   - Ensure JSON configuration format is valid
   - Use `File` facade for file operations
   - Handle system-wide MCP config file paths per OS

3. **Configuration Files**:
   - System-wide MCP config file locations:
     - macOS, Linux: `~/.config/github-copilot/intellij/mcp.json`
     - Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\github-copilot\intellij\mcp.json`

### Testing Approach

#### Automated Tests
- **Framework**: Pest PHP with Orchestra Testbench
- **Run tests**: `composer test` or `vendor/bin/pest`
- **Test coverage**: `vendor/bin/pest --coverage`
- **Test structure**: 
  - `tests/Feature/` - Feature tests for main functionality
  - `tests/TestCase.php` - Base test case with package provider setup
  - `tests/Pest.php` - Pest configuration and architecture presets
  - `tests/ArchTest.php` - Architecture rules and code quality checks

#### Writing Tests
- Use Pest PHP syntax (test functions, not classes)
- Mock `DetectionStrategyFactory` for unit tests
- Test public methods and behavior, not implementation details
- Use descriptive test names: `test('description of expected behavior')`
- Use temporary directories for file system tests and clean up after
- Follow the pattern in existing tests

#### Integration Tests
- Test with `php artisan boost:install` command in a Laravel project
- Verify system-wide MCP config file creation at correct location
- Test with `php artisan boost:update` command when switching projects
- Test in PhpStorm with GitHub Copilot plugin enabled

#### Test Requirements
- All tests must pass before merging: `composer test`
- Code must pass linting: `composer test:lint`
- Maintain test coverage above 90%
- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes

## Package Integration

### Laravel Boost Integration Points
- Extends `CodeEnvironment` base class
- Implements `McpClient` interface for MCP server setup

### MCP Configuration Format
System-wide MCP config file contains absolute path to Laravel project:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "laravel-boost": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/php",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/laravel/artisan", "boost:mcp"]
    },
    "existing-server": {
      "url": "https://example.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

**Important**: Empty arrays in the configuration are automatically removed to ensure compatibility. Some MCP tools fail when encountering empty arrays (e.g., `"headers": []`), but work correctly when the field is absent entirely. The implementation recursively removes all empty arrays before writing the configuration file.

#### WSL

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "laravel-boost": {
      "command": "wsl.exe",
      "args": [
          "/absolute/path/to/php", 
          "/absolute/path/to/laravel/artisan", 
          "boost:mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### WSL and Laravel Sail

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "laravel-boost": {
      "command": "wsl.exe",
      "args": [
          "--cd",
          "/absolute/path/to/project",
          "./vendor/bin/sail", 
          "artisan", 
          "boost:mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### macOS/Linux and Laravel Sail

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "laravel-boost": {
      "command": "bash", 
      "args": [
         "-c",
         "cd /absolute/path/to/project && ./vendor/bin/sail artisan boost:mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Important Constraints

1. **Platform Support**: Native Windows is supported (macOS, Linux, Windows)
2. **PHP Version**: Minimum PHP 8.3
3. **Laravel Version**: Minimum Laravel 12.x
4. **File Structure**: 
   - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is project-local
   - MCP config is system-wide in OS-specific locations
5. **Project Switching**: Users must run `boost:update` when switching Laravel projects

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Detection Methods
1. Update `systemDetectionConfig()` for PhpStorm and plugin detection
2. Keep detection lightweight and fast
3. Write tests in `tests/Feature/PhpStormCopilotTest.php`
4. Run `composer test` to verify

### Modifying MCP Configuration
1. Edit `installFileMcp()` method for file-based MCP installation
2. Handle OS-specific config file paths correctly
3. Use absolute paths for Laravel project location
4. Remove empty arrays from configuration before writing to ensure compatibility
5. Validate JSON format before writing
6. Add test cases for the new configuration
7. Test with temporary directories in tests

### Adding New Features
1. Write tests first (TDD approach)
2. Implement the feature
3. Run `composer test` to verify tests pass
4. Run `composer lint` to format code
5. Verify with `composer test:lint`
6. Update documentation if needed

### Updating Documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Keep installation instructions clear and concise
- Include version requirements
- Update this file for development guideline changes

# Laravel Boost Guidelines

The Laravel Boost guidelines are specifically curated by Laravel maintainers for this application. These guidelines should be followed closely to enhance the user's satisfaction building Laravel applications.

## Foundational Context
This application is a Laravel application and its main Laravel ecosystems package & versions are below. You are an expert with them all. Ensure you abide by these specific packages & versions.

- php - 8.4.15
- laravel/framework (LARAVEL) - v12
- laravel/mcp (MCP) - v0
- laravel/prompts (PROMPTS) - v0
- laravel/pint (PINT) - v1
- pestphp/pest (PEST) - v4
- phpunit/phpunit (PHPUNIT) - v12

## Conventions
- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts
- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove it works. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture
- Stick to existing directory structure - don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling
- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Replies
- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

## Documentation Files
- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.


=== boost rules ===

## Laravel Boost
- Laravel Boost is an MCP server that comes with powerful tools designed specifically for this application. Use them.

## Artisan
- Use the `list-artisan-commands` tool when you need to call an Artisan command to double check the available parameters.

## URLs
- Whenever you share a project URL with the user you should use the `get-absolute-url` tool to ensure you're using the correct scheme, domain / IP, and port.

## Tinker / Debugging
- You should use the `tinker` tool when you need to execute PHP to debug code or query Eloquent models directly.
- Use the `database-query` tool when you only need to read from the database.

## Reading Browser Logs With the `browser-logs` Tool
- You can read browser logs, errors, and exceptions using the `browser-logs` tool from Boost.
- Only recent browser logs will be useful - ignore old logs.

## Searching Documentation (Critically Important)
- Boost comes with a powerful `search-docs` tool you should use before any other approaches. This tool automatically passes a list of installed packages and their versions to the remote Boost API, so it returns only version-specific documentation specific for the user's circumstance. You should pass an array of packages to filter on if you know you need docs for particular packages.
- The 'search-docs' tool is perfect for all Laravel related packages, including Laravel, Inertia, Livewire, Filament, Tailwind, Pest, Nova, Nightwatch, etc.
- You must use this tool to search for Laravel-ecosystem documentation before falling back to other approaches.
- Search the documentation before making code changes to ensure we are taking the correct approach.
- Use multiple, broad, simple, topic based queries to start. For example: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`.
- Do not add package names to queries - package information is already shared. For example, use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Available Search Syntax
- You can and should pass multiple queries at once. The most relevant results will be returned first.

1. Simple Word Searches with auto-stemming - query=authentication - finds 'authenticate' and 'auth'
2. Multiple Words (AND Logic) - query=rate limit - finds knowledge containing both "rate" AND "limit"
3. Quoted Phrases (Exact Position) - query="infinite scroll" - Words must be adjacent and in that order
4. Mixed Queries - query=middleware "rate limit" - "middleware" AND exact phrase "rate limit"
5. Multiple Queries - queries=["authentication", "middleware"] - ANY of these terms


=== php rules ===

## PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even if it has one line.

### Constructors
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion in `__construct()`.
    - <code-snippet>public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }</code-snippet>
- Do not allow empty `__construct()` methods with zero parameters.

### Type Declarations
- Always use explicit return type declarations for methods and functions.
- Use appropriate PHP type hints for method parameters.

<code-snippet name="Explicit Return Types and Method Params" lang="php">
protected function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool
{
    ...
}
</code-snippet>

## Comments
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over comments. Never use comments within the code itself unless there is something _very_ complex going on.

## PHPDoc Blocks
- Add useful array shape type definitions for arrays when appropriate.

## Enums
- Typically, keys in an Enum should be TitleCase. For example: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.


=== laravel/core rules ===

## Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using the `list-artisan-commands` tool.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Database
- Always use proper Eloquent relationship methods with return type hints. Prefer relationship methods over raw queries or manual joins.
- Use Eloquent models and relationships before suggesting raw database queries
- Avoid `DB::`; prefer `Model::query()`. Generate code that leverages Laravel's ORM capabilities rather than bypassing them.
- Generate code that prevents N+1 query problems by using eager loading.
- Use Laravel's query builder for very complex database operations.

### Model Creation
- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `list-artisan-commands` to check the available options to `php artisan make:model`.

### APIs & Eloquent Resources
- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

### Controllers & Validation
- Always create Form Request classes for validation rather than inline validation in controllers. Include both validation rules and custom error messages.
- Check sibling Form Requests to see if the application uses array or string based validation rules.

### Queues
- Use queued jobs for time-consuming operations with the `ShouldQueue` interface.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization features (gates, policies, Sanctum, etc.).

### URL Generation
- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

### Configuration
- Use environment variables only in configuration files - never use the `env()` function directly outside of config files. Always use `config('app.name')`, not `env('APP_NAME')`.

### Testing
- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

### Vite Error
- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.


=== laravel/v12 rules ===

## Laravel 12

- Use the `search-docs` tool to get version specific documentation.
- Since Laravel 11, Laravel has a new streamlined file structure which this project uses.

### Laravel 12 Structure
- No middleware files in `app/Http/Middleware/`.
- `bootstrap/app.php` is the file to register middleware, exceptions, and routing files.
- `bootstrap/providers.php` contains application specific service providers.
- **No app\Console\Kernel.php** - use `bootstrap/app.php` or `routes/console.php` for console configuration.
- **Commands auto-register** - files in `app/Console/Commands/` are automatically available and do not require manual registration.

### Database
- When modifying a column, the migration must include all of the attributes that were previously defined on the column. Otherwise, they will be dropped and lost.
- Laravel 11 allows limiting eagerly loaded records natively, without external packages: `$query->latest()->limit(10);`.

### Models
- Casts can and likely should be set in a `casts()` method on a model rather than the `$casts` property. Follow existing conventions from other models.


=== pint/core rules ===

## Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- You must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint` to fix any formatting issues.


=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest
### Testing
- If you need to verify a feature is working, write or update a Unit / Feature test.

### Pest Tests
- All tests must be written using Pest. Use `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- You must not remove any tests or test files from the tests directory without approval. These are not temporary or helper files - these are core to the application.
- Tests should test all of the happy paths, failure paths, and weird paths.
- Tests live in the `tests/Feature` and `tests/Unit` directories.
- Pest tests look and behave like this:
<code-snippet name="Basic Pest Test Example" lang="php">
it('is true', function () {
    expect(true)->toBeTrue();
});
</code-snippet>

### Running Tests
- Run the minimal number of tests using an appropriate filter before finalizing code edits.
- To run all tests: `php artisan test`.
- To run all tests in a file: `php artisan test tests/Feature/ExampleTest.php`.
- To filter on a particular test name: `php artisan test --filter=testName` (recommended after making a change to a related file).
- When the tests relating to your changes are passing, ask the user if they would like to run the entire test suite to ensure everything is still passing.

### Pest Assertions
- When asserting status codes on a response, use the specific method like `assertForbidden` and `assertNotFound` instead of using `assertStatus(403)` or similar, e.g.:
<code-snippet name="Pest Example Asserting postJson Response" lang="php">
it('returns all', function () {
    $response = $this->postJson('/api/docs', []);

    $response->assertSuccessful();
});
</code-snippet>

### Mocking
- Mocking can be very helpful when appropriate.
- When mocking, you can use the `Pest\Laravel\mock` Pest function, but always import it via `use function Pest\Laravel\mock;` before using it. Alternatively, you can use `$this->mock()` if existing tests do.
- You can also create partial mocks using the same import or self method.

### Datasets
- Use datasets in Pest to simplify tests which have a lot of duplicated data. This is often the case when testing validation rules, so consider going with this solution when writing tests for validation rules.

<code-snippet name="Pest Dataset Example" lang="php">
it('has emails', function (string $email) {
    expect($email)->not->toBeEmpty();
})->with([
    'james' => 'james@laravel.com',
    'taylor' => 'taylor@laravel.com',
]);
</code-snippet>


=== pest/v4 rules ===

## Pest 4

- Pest v4 is a huge upgrade to Pest and offers: browser testing, smoke testing, visual regression testing, test sharding, and faster type coverage.
- Browser testing is incredibly powerful and useful for this project.
- Browser tests should live in `tests/Browser/`.
- Use the `search-docs` tool for detailed guidance on utilizing these features.

### Browser Testing
- You can use Laravel features like `Event::fake()`, `assertAuthenticated()`, and model factories within Pest v4 browser tests, as well as `RefreshDatabase` (when needed) to ensure a clean state for each test.
- Interact with the page (click, type, scroll, select, submit, drag-and-drop, touch gestures, etc.) when appropriate to complete the test.
- If requested, test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- If requested, test on different devices and viewports (like iPhone 14 Pro, tablets, or custom breakpoints).
- Switch color schemes (light/dark mode) when appropriate.
- Take screenshots or pause tests for debugging when appropriate.

### Example Tests

<code-snippet name="Pest Browser Test Example" lang="php">
it('may reset the password', function () {
    Notification::fake();

    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create());

    $page = visit('/sign-in'); // Visit on a real browser...

    $page->assertSee('Sign In')
        ->assertNoJavascriptErrors() // or ->assertNoConsoleLogs()
        ->click('Forgot Password?')
        ->fill('email', 'nuno@laravel.com')
        ->click('Send Reset Link')
        ->assertSee('We have emailed your password reset link!')

    Notification::assertSent(ResetPassword::class);
});
</code-snippet>

<code-snippet name="Pest Smoke Testing Example" lang="php">
$pages = visit(['/', '/about', '/contact']);

$pages->assertNoJavascriptErrors()->assertNoConsoleLogs();
</code-snippet>


=== revolution/laravel-boost-copilot-cli rules ===

## Laravel Boost for GitHub Copilot CLI

### MCP Configuration File Required
- If you cannot see the `laravel-boost` MCP server or tools, the user has likely forgotten to specify the MCP configuration file when starting Copilot CLI.
- Instruct the user to restart Copilot CLI with the correct command:
  ```
  copilot --additional-mcp-config @.github/mcp-config.json --continue
  ```
- The `--additional-mcp-config` option is **required** for every Copilot CLI session to access Laravel Boost MCP tools.

### Laravel Package Development Environment
- This is a **Laravel package development project** using Orchestra Testbench, not a standard Laravel application.
- The environment differs significantly from a typical Laravel project - there is no full application context, database, or application-specific models.
- **Important:** Not all Laravel Boost MCP tools will work correctly in this environment:
  - Tools that depend on database connections, specific models, application routes, or other application-specific features may not be available or may fail.
  - Tools like `database-query`, `database-schema`, `list-routes` may return limited or no results.
  - Basic tools like `application-info`, `list-artisan-commands`, `search-docs` should work normally.
- Focus on package-specific development tasks: writing tests, implementing package features, and ensuring compatibility with Laravel.
- Use `vendor/bin/testbench` commands instead of `php artisan` when needed.
